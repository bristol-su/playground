= The homepage

The Homepage should generally list all available modules, and allow you
to spin up a module instance or open an old module instance. The
homepage looks like the below:

Clicking on new uses the API to create a new module instance. It also
creates a new activity for each module instance, where the
'activity_for' parameter is specified when the module is set up. Having
done this, it redirects to the module page and allows the SDK to take
over the rendering of the module.

We can also retrieve all module instances through the API for a specific
module. This allows us to list the previously created modules when
'Open' is pressed, and is a simple case of redirecting a user to the
module instance when they click open.

This whole process simply uses the API to render information on the
frontend, and redirects the user when a module instance is requested to
be rendered.
