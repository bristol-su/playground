## About The Project

This Laravel based site enables modules to be opened and edited instantly, providing a much more flexible sandbox than the portal.

Individual settings, permissions and third party connections can be changed for each module, and the effects instantly seen. Additionally, modules in the sandbox can be saved and shared, providing a collaborative environment for building modules.

We recommend using the playground to learn how different modules work and what settings/permissions you should have for your modules in the portal.

## Getting Started

Clone the package to your computer.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bristol-su/playground
```

Install the dependencies
